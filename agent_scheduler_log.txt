  "linkedinMessage": "Hi Mitch,\n\nI noticed Chubb Law specializes in high-stakes Personal Injury and Wrongful Death cases, so I generated a **\"Zero-Trust\" AI Strategy** specifically for your practice.\n\nIt includes 10 ready-to-use workflows—including **\"Auto Accident Demand Letter Automation\"** and **\"FMCSA Deposition Questioning\"**—that use an \"anonymization sandwich\" technique. This allows your team to use AI for complex drafting and medical record summarization without ever exposing privileged client data or violating HIPAA.\n\nI've attached the PDF. You can preview the prompts directly here in the chat.\n\nBest,\nSanjeev"
