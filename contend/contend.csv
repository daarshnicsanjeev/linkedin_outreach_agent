"Jan 12 (Mon)","The 'Tire Kicker' Problem","You spend 20 minutes on a consultation call, only to realize they can't afford your retainer.","Focus on 'Lead Qualification.' Lawyers hate wasting time on bad leads. Describe an AI Intake Agent that asks the budget/case details *before* the lawyer ever gets on the phone. It filters out the bad leads so the lawyer only talks to serious clients.","I built a 'Gatekeeper' bot that filters bad leads automatically. Want to see a video of how it works? DM me 'GATEKEEPER'."
"Jan 13 (Tue)","The 'Unused Tech' Reality","You are paying $100s/month for Clio/MyCase, but you're likely only using 10% of its power.","Build authority by mentioning the software they already use (Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther). Most firms use these just as a database. Explain that 'Automation' acts as the glue that makes these tools actually do work (like auto-generating invoices).","Let's unlock the other 90% of your software. DM me the name of your practice management software and I'll send you one automation tip for it."
"Jan 14 (Wed)","The Cost of Interruptions","It takes 23 minutes to refocus after a single interruption. How many times did your phone ring today?","Focus on 'Deep Work.' Lawyers need focus to draft motions/contracts. Every phone call breaks that focus. Pitch AI not just as a time-saver, but as a 'Focus Defender' that handles the noise so they can think.","I help lawyers build 'Focus Mode' workflows. DM me if you want to stop the constant interruptions."
"Jan 15 (Thu)","The 'Magic Trick' (Prototype Showcase)","Watch me turn a messy voicemail into a perfectly formatted PDF case file in 30 seconds.","Describe a specific workflow you have built. 1. Client leaves voicemail. 2. AI transcribes it. 3. AI extracts key dates/facts. 4. AI drafts a memo. 5. AI saves it to Drive. This shows *competence* without needing a client testimonial.","I am looking for 3 firms to beta test this 'Voicemail-to-Memo' workflow for free. First come, first served."
"Jan 16 (Fri)","The Weekend Protection","Will you be working this Saturday? If the answer is 'Yes', something is broken.","Friday afternoon guilt. Many lawyers work weekends to catch up on admin. Position automation as the tool that buys them their weekend back. If the robot does the admin on Friday, the lawyer can rest on Saturday.","My goal is to get you offline by 6 PM today. DM me 'WEEKEND' and let's chat about automating your Friday wrap-up."
